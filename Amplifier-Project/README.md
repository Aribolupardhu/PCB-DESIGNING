# Amplifier PCB Design

## Overview
This project is a basic amplifier circuit designed as part of my PCB design learning.
The schematic was created using EasyEDA.

## Tool Used
- EasyEDA (Schematic Design)

## Project Status
- Schematic: Completed
- PCB Layout: In Progress
- Fabrication: Not Started

## Objective
To understand amplifier circuit design and prepare it for PCB layout.

## Bill of Materials
See the [BOM](BOM.md) for component details.

## Design Considerations
- Selected LM358 due to single-supply operation
- Used 2-layer PCB for simplicity and low cost
- Decoupling capacitors added near IC power pins

## PCB Design Rules
- Minimum trace width: 10 mil
- Ground plane used for noise reduction
- Signal traces kept short

## What I Learned
- Importance of proper grounding
- Component placement impact on routing
- Common schematic-to-PCB mistakes
